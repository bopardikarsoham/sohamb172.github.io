I am a first year Master's in Computer Engineering Candidate at New York University. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from College of Engineering Pune. 

I am a Qiskit Advocate and have been actively involved in quantum computing since the start of my undergraduate studies. Over the years, I have dedicated myself to this field and gained substantial experience in quantum machine learning, tensor networks, and quantum simulations.

**Research:** Quantum Algorithms and Near-Term Applications.
